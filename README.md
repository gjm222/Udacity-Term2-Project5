# Term 2 Project 5 : CarND-Controls-MPC Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

---
## Objective
The objective is to get information from the simulator which includes waypoints and vehicle state and use it to determine steering angle and accelleration that is sent back to the simulator to control the vehicle.

## The Model


## Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration (N & dt)
## Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing
## Model Predictive Control with Latency
